Since I grew up in Missouri, I have been a Kansas City Chiefs and Royals fan all my life. I am also a basketball fan but do not have a favorite professional team I enjoy. The player I enjoy watching the most though is Russell Westbrook.
You can view a dunking photo of Russell Westbrook <a href=<https://www.zimbio.com/photos/Russell+Westbrook/Oklahoma+City+Thunder+v+Cleveland+Cavaliers/87bWQbiGxTG>here</a>
